            <p><b>1. Economic Benefits</b><br><br>

                <b>Provides Job Opportunities:</b> Urban farming involves many activities such as production,
                processing, marketing, and delivery that need a team of people. Due to this, there is a need to hire a
                lot of people to help fill these roles. So, urban farming helps to create jobs for people in the
                community.<br>
                <b>Provides Money for Local Government:</b> Lands set aside for urban farming by the government are a
                source of money for local governments. Then community organizations can use the money earned for the
                smooth running of community activities.

            <p><b>2. Environmental Benefits</b><br><br>
                <b>Put Wasted Lands to Good Use:</b> Unused land in cities can become dumping grounds for waste and
                cause environmental problems. Crime can also be a problem in these areas as well. So, lands changed into
                edible landscapes through urban farming can help reduce environmental pollution and crime.<br>
                <b>Reduces Local Carbon Footprint:</b> Local carbon footprints are the total amount of bad gas, carbon
                dioxide, created from transportation and production. Since urban farming is usually done right in the
                cities where people live, there is a smaller local carbon footprint. Not having to drive the vegetables
                and fruits to other locations helps to make the environment safer to live in.

            <p><b>3. Health and Nutrition Benefits</b><br><br>
                <b>Provides Easy Access to Fresh Food: </b>Ico.uk found that the UK imports 84% of its fruits and 46% of
                vegetables. With urban farming, people don’t need as much processed, or canned food. Therefore, urban
                farms make it easier to get fresh food. Overall, food produced by urban farmers in their communities
                helps promote healthy living.<br>
                <b>Provides Food Security:</b> Getting food from other locations lessens food security. When people move
                food it can pick up germs or diseases. Urban farming can help reduce the need to transport food. Making
                food available in the communities where it is grown is key. Since it helps ensure there will always be
                enough food. Additionally, not needing to pay to truck food around also reduces costs. This makes food
                cheaper for everyone.<br>
                <b>Prevents Food Damage:</b> People living within a community are the ones making the farm goods. Then
                the food is sold within the same community. Overall, this helps food get to customers and ensure food
                doesn’t get damaged from transporting.

            <p><b>4. Educational Benefits</b><br><br>The educational benefits of urban farming are also important.<br>
                <b>Provides Training and Skill Development:</b> Urban farming helps people to learn new farming skills.
                These skills go beyond just growing to beekeeping, snail raising, poultry farming, and many other
                money-making farming practices.<br>
                <b>Improves Innovation:</b> Farmers learn new skills. From their new experiences in urban farming, they
                can create new ways to improve existing farming systems. They can also improve other farms.
