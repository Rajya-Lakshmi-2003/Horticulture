        <p>Horticulture is the cultivation of plants in gardens or greenhouses, as opposed to the field-scale production
            of crops characteristic of agriculture. It includes the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds,
            herbs, sprouts, mushrooms, algae, flowers, seaweeds and non-food crops such as grass and ornamental trees
            and plants. It also includes plant conservation, landscape restoration, landscape and garden design,
            construction, and maintenance, and arboriculture, ornamental trees and lawns.

            In anthropology, horticulture refers to a subsistence strategy characterized by the small-scale,
            non-industrial cultivation of plants for food. Horticulture involves the use of hand tools such as digging
            sticks, hoes and carrying baskets. In contrast to horticulture, agriculture is viewed by anthropologists as
            a more intensive strategy involving the use of plowing, animal traction and complex techniques of irrigation
            and soil management.

            The study and practice of horticulture have been traced back many years. Horticulture contributed to the
            transition from nomadic human communities to sedentary, or semi-sedentary, horticultural communities.
            Horticulture is divided into several categories which focus on the cultivation and processing of different
            types of plants and food items for specific purposes. In order to conserve the science of horticulture,
            multiple organizations worldwide educate, encourage, and promote the advancement of horticulture.</p>

            <strong style="text-decoration-line:underline">Definition</strong><br>
            Horticulture, from Latin hortus meaning garden and colere meaning to cultivate, focuses on the use of small
            plots, in contrast to agronomy which involves intensive crop farming and large-scale field crop production
            of grains and forages or forestry involving forest trees and products derived from them. It deals with
            garden crops such as ornamental plants grown for their appearance, fruits and vegetable and spices grown for
            their food value, and medicinal plants.
