                <strong style="text-decoration-line:underline">Olericulture</strong><br>
                Olericulture deals with the production, storage, processing and marketing of vegetables. It encompasses
                crop establishment, including cultivar selection, seedbed preparation and establishment of vegetable
                crops by seed and transplants.

                It also includes maintenance and care of vegetable crops as well commercial and non-traditional
                vegetable crop production including organic gardening and organic farming; sustainable agriculture and
                horticulture; hydroponics; and biotechnology.

                <strong style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Viticulture</strong><br>
                Viticulture (from the Latin word for vine) or winegrowing (wine growing) is the cultivation and
                harvesting of grapes. It is a branch of the science of horticulture. While the native territory of Vitis
                vinifera, the common grape vine, ranges from Western Europe to the Persian shores of the Caspian Sea,
                the vine has demonstrated high levels of adaptability to new environments, hence viticulture can be
                found on every continent except Antarctica.

                Duties of the viticulturist include monitoring and controlling pests and diseases, fertilizing,
                irrigation, canopy management, monitoring fruit development and characteristics, deciding when to
                harvest, and vine pruning during the winter months. Viticulturists are often intimately involved with
                winemakers, because vineyard management and the resulting grape characteristics provide the basis from
                which winemaking can begin. A great number of varieties are now approved in the European Union as true
                grapes for winegrowing and viticulture.

                <strong style="text-decoration-line:underline ;">Floriculture</strong><br>
                Floriculture is the study of the efficient production of the plants that produce showy, colorful flowers
                and foliage for human enjoyment and the human environment. It is a commercially successful branch of
                horticulture and agriculture found throughout the world. Efficient production practices have been
                developed over the years, for the hundreds of plant taxa used in the floral industry, increasing the
                overall knowledge of whole plant biology. Plant breeding and selection have produced tens of thousands
                of new genotypes for human use. Jasmine, Marigold,Chrysanthemum, Rose, Orchid, Anthurium etc. are
                flowers of commercial demand.

                <strong style="text-decoration-line:underline ;">Postharvest</strong><br>
                In agriculture, postharvest handling is the stage of crop production immediately following harvest,
                including cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing. The instant a crop is removed from the ground, or
                separated from its parent plant, it begins to deteriorate. Postharvest treatment largely determines
                final quality, whether a crop is sold for fresh consumption, or used as an ingredient in a processed
                food product.
